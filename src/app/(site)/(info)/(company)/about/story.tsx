              We weren't looking to reinvent affiliate marketing â€” we were just
              trying to get our own cashback to work. But what we found instead
              was a system full of delays, vague points, and platforms that felt
              rigged against users. That frustration led to an idea: What if
              cashback was built by people who actually use it?
