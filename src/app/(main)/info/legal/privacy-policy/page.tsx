            In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Notice unless otherwise required by law.
          </p>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed">
            We retain personal information only as long as it's necessary for the purposes described in this notice, or if a longer retention period is required by law (e.g., tax or legal obligations). We will not retain your information beyond the duration of your account activity unless required to do so.
          </p>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed">
            When no longer needed, we will either delete or anonymize your information. If deletion or anonymization isn't immediately possible (e.g., because it is stored in backup archives), we will securely store and isolate your information from further processing until deletion can occur.
          </p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mb-4">8. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h2>

          </p>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed">
            We use appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational safeguards to protect your personal information. These include security processes that aim to prevent unauthorized access, disclosure, or misuse.
          </p>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed">
            However, no digital system is 100% secure. We cannot guarantee that cybercriminals or other unauthorized third parties won't bypass our security. Therefore, access and transmission of your data is at your own risk. For optimal safety, use the Services in a secure environment.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold text-secondary mb-4">9. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h2>

            In Short: We do not knowingly collect data from or market to children under 18 years of age.
          </p>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed">

          </p>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed">
            If we learn that we've collected information from someone under 18 without parental or guardian consent, we will promptly deactivate the account and delete the data.

          </p>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed">

          <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed">
            Most browsers and some mobile systems include a Do-Not-Track (DNT) feature or setting you can use to signal your preference not to be tracked online. However, no uniform standard has been adopted for DNT signals, so we do not currently respond to DNT browser settings.
          </p>

          <p className="text-muted-foreground text-lg leading-relaxed">
            If a standard for online tracking is adopted in the future, we will update you in a revised version of this Privacy Notice.
