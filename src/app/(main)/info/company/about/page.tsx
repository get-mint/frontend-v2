            <p className="text-lg">
              Mint was founded by three students who were tired of watching brands pocket billions in affiliate rewards that never reached consumers. So we built something better: a transparent cashback tool that gives you your fair share ‚Äî automatically.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              But Mint is more than a browser extension. We're building a platform where transparency is standard ‚Äî and where people always get their fair share.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg">
              Born in dorm rooms at the University of Chicago and Bentley University, Mint is powered by students, shoppers, and builders who believe cashback shouldn't be a mystery. It should be effortless, honest, and built for everyone.
