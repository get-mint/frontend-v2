              We started Mint Cashback because we were tired of platforms that
              felt like black boxes: delays, point systems, and hoops to jump
              through. So we asked: what if cashback was rebuilt by people who
              actually use it? That idea became Mint Cashback â€” a simpler,
              smarter way to save.
